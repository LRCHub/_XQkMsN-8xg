November
No trace of your perfume
No evidence of you, no
Remember
My fingers in your hair
The heat behind your stare
I'm in the kitchen,
rollin' at a party
Deep in the canyon
Dance with anybody
That's when you walk in
Holding onto someone new
It kills me
But we say, "Hello"
Say, "Goodbye"
And I swear
I died a thousand times
So, what's it like to reach
the other side?
Of letting go and moving on
Don't know why it's taking me
so long
Oh, maybe you can tell me what
it's like
On the other side
On the other side
A cruel summer
That spring was gone too soon
'Fore the mess in June, oh
I'm pulled under
I thought the tides would change
But now you're just a stranger
I'm in the kitchen,
rollin' at a party
Deep in the canyon
Dance with anybody
That's when you walk in
Holding onto someone new
It kills me
But we say, "Hello"
Say, "Goodbye"
And I swear
I died a thousand times
So, what's it like to reach
the other side?
Of letting go and moving on
Don't know why it's taking me
so long
Oh, maybe you can tell me what
it's like
On the other side
We say, "Hello"
Say, "Goodbye"
And I swear
I died a thousand times
So, what's it like to reach
the other side?
Of letting go and moving on
Don't know why it's taking me
so long
Oh, maybe you can tell me what
it's like
On the other side
